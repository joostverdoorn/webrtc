# Build
## Requirements
* NodeJS 0.10.x
* CoffeeScript 1.6.3

##Initial Build
`cake deploy`

##Subsequent builds
`cake build`

##Cleaning
`cake clean`

##Watch for changes
To automatically build the project when a file is changed `cake watch` can be used. This is useful when actively developing to prevent the constant execution of `cake build`.

##Running
`cake run`

This starts a listenserver on `localhost:8080` which responds to `index.html` for the game, `node.html` for a node that connects to other nodes and `nodegraph.html` for a visualization of the networktopology.

##Tests
`cake test`

This executes all tests and shows the output in the console. For the test-coverage a listenserver on `localhost:8081` is launched which visualizes the covered codelines.
