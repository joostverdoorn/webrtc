WebRTC
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
WebRTC, or Web Real-Time Communication, is an API definition that enables
 the webbrowser to directly communicate with other webbrowsers.
 At the time of writing, the API is still being drafted by the World Wide
 Web Consortium (W3C), the main standards organization for the World Wide
 Web.
 WebRTC first saw the light of day when Google open-sourced an early version
 of the API in May 2011, and has evolved to the point that there are now
 advanced implementations in several modern webbrowsers.

Peer-to-Peer
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A peer-to-peer network is a decentralized distributed network architecture.
 It means that the nodes in this network can communicate with each other
 without any interaction with the server which keeps a track of all nodes.
 The nodes in the network can communicate with each other without any interactio
n with a central server.
 This advantage brings a disadvantage that there is no global clock.

Infrastructure
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The simplest form of a peer to peer network is an 
\emph on
unstructured
\emph default
 network.
 Nodes are randomly connected with each other and share data inefficiently.
 All nodes have the same roles in this network.
 It is usually better to implement some kind of overlay network to help
 the nodes find each other and transmit data, to create a 
\emph on
structured
\emph default
 network.
 For example the nodes with more bandwidth operate as super nodes and help
 the other nodes to communicate with each other.
 Geo location can also be one of the ways to structure the network.
